	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity, efficient - To express the time complexity of an algorithm, we use something called the “Big O notation”. The Big O notation is a language we use to describe the time complexity of an algorithm. It's how we compare the efficiency of different approaches to a problem, and helps us to make decisions.</p>
