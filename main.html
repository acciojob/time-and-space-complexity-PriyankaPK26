	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity, efficient - To express the time complexity of an algorithm, we use something called the “Big O notation”. The Big O notation is a language we use to describe the time complexity of an algorithm. It's how we compare the efficiency of different approaches to a problem, and helps us to make decisions.</p>
	<p>Space Complexity, O(n) - To express the time complexity of an algorithm, we use something called the “Big O notation”. The Big O notation is a language we use to describe the time complexity of an algorithm. It's how we compare the efficiency of different approaches to a problem, and helps us to make decisions.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> - Space complexity refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution. Calculate the space occupied by variables in an algorithm/program to determine space complexity.</p>
